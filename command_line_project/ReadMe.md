# Timesheet notes tool
### A mini command-line project using Python. 
This program is designed to help the user easily make quick notes on the different tasks that they have worked on a given day without having to open SAP and complete their formal timesheet every day. At the end of the week, the user can view their notes in this program when they are completing their formal timesheet in SAP. Users can:
1. Add timesheet notes against each day of the week
2. View all timesheet notes for the week
3. Clear all entries for the week i.e. reset their timesheet notes

## Benefits of the timesheet notes tool
- Better timesheet accuracy as avoids recall difficulties on a Friday about exactly what you did on the Monday
- Better time management as avoids the need to open and complete your timesheet in SAP everyday
- Faster timesheets on a Friday afternoon = faster post-work pints at the pub!

## Requirements & set-up
### Users of the tool will need [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to complete the following steps:
1. Clone the repo to your machine.
2. Run the file using `timesheet_tool.py`.

## Current tool limitations (potential future enhancements)
- Is only able of clearing all entries for the week, rather than just for a specific day
- Is not capable of combining duplicate entries for a timesheet code into a single entry
- Is not capable of aggregating entries for a day to give a total time worked for the day
